# Multi-Threaded Asteroid simulation

Work of paralelism with OpenMP in C++ with Bash Script.

The project consist of a simulation with a variable ammount of asteroids and planets including gravitational interactions and collisions. The objective is to implement this simulation and boost its performance with multi-thread parallelization.

Bash Script is used to automate testing and check that no precision is lost in the multi-threaded version.
